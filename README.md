<h2><em> This was the first ever laravel project made by myself. It only features basic CRUD operations and some basic bootstrap classes for spacing and displaying the records in the database. </em></h2>

<h1>Requirements to run this project</h1>
<h3 align="center"> There are 2 ways of installing the required tools for this laravel project: </h3>
<h2> By Installing the tools one by one </h2>
<ul>
   <li>PHP >= 7.4 https://devdojo.com/tnylea/installing-php-on-windows </li>
   <li>composer https://getcomposer.org/ </li>
   <li>Mysql server https://www.sqlshack.com/how-to-install-mysql-database-server-8-0-19-on-windows-10/ </li>
</ul>
<h2> Or by simply installing XAMPP which already includes PHP, Apache server and Mysql</h2>
<ul>

</ul>
<h1>Once the requirements are fullfilled, we can download or clone repository, install the project and run it</h1>

         <li><p> composer update </p></li>
         <li><p> php artisan serve (this will launch the laravel development server)</li>
